    "`Ans) Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.

We may gather some details that are irrelevant when developing a banking application. Hence, we have to choose only valuable information like name, address, tax info, etc. The process of fetching, removing, and selecting the customer information from a pool of data is called Abstraction.\n",

We don’t have to understand the internal working of these features. For example, we don’t need to know how our camera recognizes a human face in an image or how it calculates gamma correction. We simply need to learn the software interface. So, it is a real-world example of encapsulation.\n",
